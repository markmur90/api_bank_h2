Dynamic DNS (DDNS)

Njalla supports dynamic DNS records, once you added a 'Dynamic' entry to your domain, you can update the record with a simple HTTPS GET call. There are several options to update the record. You can set an IPv4 and/or IPv6 address or you can use the address used to make the request. You can get a JSON response with the current status of your record or only look for HTTP Response status:

In the DNS Settings of your domain you get a key for each dynamic subdomain you define. with that you can construct the following URLs:

Set IPv4:

https://njal.la/update/?h=<subdomain>&k=<key>&a=192.168.1.1

Set IPv6:

https://njal.la/update/?h=<subdomain>&k=<key>&aaaa=::1

Set IPv4 and IPv6:

https://njal.la/update/?h=<subdomain>&k=<key>&a=192.168.1.1&aaaa=::1

Use IP from request, can be IPv4 or IPv6:

https://njal.la/update/?h=<subdomain>&k=<key>&auto

Return empty response on success with status 200, print errors:

https://njal.la/update/?h=<subdomain>&k=<key>&auto&quiet
