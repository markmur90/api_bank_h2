Certificate based Authentication

Some APIs only allow certificate based authentication.
Generally

During the app creation as well as the go-live request you will be asked to provide:

    the complete SSL certificate trust chain

    in .pem format (either manually or via file upload)

    in the following order:

    --BEGIN CERTIFICATE-- (The primary SSL certificate: your_domain_name.crt)
    --END CERTIFICATE--
    --BEGIN CERTIFICATE-- (The intermediate certificate: intermediateCert.crt)
    --END CERTIFICATE--
    --BEGIN CERTIFICATE-- (The root certificate: trustedRoot.crt)
    --END CERTIFICATE--

You need to use 2-way TLS for the connection to the API and the according certificate.
