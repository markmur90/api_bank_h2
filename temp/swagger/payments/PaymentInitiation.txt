PaymentInitiation

Description
Instant payments – testing from Developer Portal

1. Enables you to 
- check if the account to which you are trying to make a payment is reachable for instant SEPA Credit Transfer, 
- initiate an instant SEPA credit transfer and 
- check its processing status.

Steps: 
1. Check if target IBAN is reachable 
2. Get an OTP 
3. Initiate an instant payment 
4. Simulate payment processing (Simulation only) 
5. Check the status of the instant payment


Detailed description of the single flow steps


1. Check if target IBAN is reachable 
This is an optional step, but it can limit the number of unsuccessful requests for initiating instant payments, as it allows you to know upfront whether the IBAN to which you are trying to make the instant payment supports this functionality or not.
On Simulator environment you will always receive a positive answer, regardless of the IBAN, provided it has the right format.
In order to check if an IBAN is reachable, you must send a GET request, specifying the IBAN you are trying to check as a path parameter.

Example GET call
/gw/dbapi/paymentInitiation/payments/v1/instantSepaCreditTransfers/creditorAccounts/{iban}/reachabilityStatus

Example JSON response
{
  "isInstantPaymentReachable": "true"
}


2. Get OTP
The initiation of an instant payment is subject to the use of a Second Factor for Authorization (2FA), so in order to be able to perform this action, you first need to retrieve an OTP in form a proof token.
You can find out in detail how to do it by visiting our Explorer -> Others -> transactionAuthorization description page.
After following the described steps, you will get a proof token which will be specified in the payment request header. Make sure that you provide the details specific to the initiation of an instant SEPA credit transfer with the specific challenge methods, and that the transaction specific data matches that of the instant payment initiation request.

Challenge method list:
- mTAN (mobileTAN)
- photoTANT(base64 encoded PNG image)
- pushTAN (push notification TAN) – for the pushTAN challenge method, please skip this step and go directly to ‘Initiate Instant Payment’

Below you can find a mapping for the required fields for the challenge request using
POST /gw/dbapi/others/transactionAuthorization/v1

All other steps required to retrieve an OTP can be performed as described, without any instant payments specific action being needed.

OTP attribute
name	                        Value	                                            Instant Payment attribute name	        Sample value
method	                      mTAN or photoTAN		                                                                      mTAN
requestType	                  "INSTANT_SEPA_CREDIT_TRANSFERS"		                                                        "INSTANT_SEPA_CREDIT_TRANSFERS"
requestData.type	            "challengeRequestDataInstantSepaCreditTransfers"		                                      "challengeRequestDataInstantSepaCreditTransfers"
requestData.targetIban		                                                      creditorAccount.iban	                  "DE84641730140101873800"
requestData.amountCurrency		                                                  instructedAmount.currencyCode	          "EUR"
requestData.amountValue	      Value: number (double$)	                          instructedAmount.amount	                135.1


3. Initiate instant payment
With the one-time password (OTP) you obtained on the previous step as header, you can now initiate the instant payment. For the pushTAN method we will include the method name as header (otp = PUSHTAN).
To ensure the uniqueness of a payment initiation, you also need to provide an idempotency ID in the form of an UUID. In the event of receiving a 500 response from our services, you should send the same idempotency ID during retries, to avoid multiple processing of the same request.
If the pushTAN method is used, a push notification is sent to the customer’s photoTAN app for approval whenever an instant payment is initiated. The customer needs to accept or reject the payment and based on this action the payment transaction is sent for execution.
Please note that on Simulator environment idempotency is not supported.

Example POST call
POST / gw/dbapi/paymentInitiation/payments/v1/instantSepaCreditTransfers

Example request header
idempotency-id: 5f4282a3-5460-472d-af59-974ec043d99d otp: eyJhbGciO…dOj6WHg

Example POST data
{
  "debtorAccount": {
    "currencyCode": "EUR",
    "iban": "DE10010000000000010790"
  },
  "instructedAmount": {
    "amount": 135.1,
    "currencyCode": "EUR"
  },
  "creditorName": "Test Name",
  "creditorAccount": {
    "currencyCode": "EUR",
    "iban": "DE84641730140101873800"
  }
}

Keep in mind that debtorAccount.iban must match one of the user’s, or in the Simulator environment test user’s, IBANs otherwise your request will fail.

Example JSON response
{
  "paymentId": "RTE73e05243-a44c-4e4a-b326-104d69a4b86c",
  "transactionStatus": "PDNG"
}


4. Simulate payment processing (Simulation only)
In order to allow you to test on Simulation environment, cases for both successful and unsuccessful payment execution, with their corresponding transaction status, we offer you the possibility to either accept or reject an initiated payment from Developer Portal Dashboard.
After initiating a payment in the previous step, you can choose how it is processed by going to the Dashboard => My Test Users => Select the test user for whom you initiated the instant payment => View details => Accounts => Pending payments
From here, you can either accept or reject the payment, using the corresponding button.

Accept instant payment
Once an instant payment is accepted, its status changes from PDNG to ACCP, the corresponding amount is subtracted from the account balance and the transaction becomes visible as a booked transaction. At this point, the status cannot be further changed.

Reject instant payment
Once an instant payment is rejected, its status changes from PDNG to RJCT, a payment rejection reason is made available and no transaction is generated. At this point, the status cannot be further changed.


5. Check the status of the instant payment
The processing of an instant payment may not be finished by the time you receive an answer for your payment initiation request payment using the POST/…instantSepaCreditTranfers endpoint. Because of this, for up to 5 minutes from the moment you initiated the instant payment, you are allowed to check for the status of said instant payment using the paymentId you received as a response to your POST request.
On Simulator environment you are in control of the instant payment execution, so depending on the moment in time you send the request to check the status of the instant payment and the selected execution type, you can receive as response one of the three transaction statuses and their corresponding details.

Example GET call
GET / gw/dbapi/paymentInitiation/payments/v1/instantSepaCreditTransfers/RTE73e05243-a44c-4e4a-b326-104d69a4b86c

Example JSON response
Pending instant payment
{
  "transactionStatus": "PDNG"
}

Accepted instant payment
{
  "transactionStatus": "ACCP"
}

Rejected instant payment
{
  "transactionStatus": "RJCT",
  "messages": {
    "code": "PAYMENT_FAILED",
    "text": "The payment could not be processed",
    "category": "ERROR"
  }
}

Error messages
Code	Message	                              Example variable values
0	    Forbidden	
2	    "Invalid value for parameter {0}"	    “instructedAmount.currencyCode”
3	    "Server error detected"	

Payment rejection reasons and messages
On Simulator environment we offer only a generic payment rejection reason for the case in which you choose to reject the instant payment, as described at Step 4.
